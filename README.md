# Stop The Steal: Bike Anti Theft

## About The Project

### Motivation

1. **Tonnes of e-waste being generated in the form of phones**: The rapid advancement of technology and consumer demand for new devices contribute to the massive generation of electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste poses environmental challenges due to hazardous materials contained in electronic devices. By repurposing old phones as anti-theft devices, we can give them a second life and reduce the amount of e-waste sent to landfills. This approach aligns with the principles of sustainability and responsible consumption, promoting the reuse of existing resources.

2. **UCSD's bike theft problem**: Bike theft has become a significant issue on the UC San Diego (UCSD) campus, with a noticeable increase in recent years. Bike theft not only leads to financial loss for individuals but also disrupts campus life and affects the overall safety and security of the campus community. By utilizing old phones as anti-theft devices, we can develop a cost-effective solution to address this problem. These devices can serve as effective deterrents and help track stolen bikes, increasing the chances of recovery and discouraging potential thieves. Implementing such a solution demonstrates a commitment to improving campus security and enhancing the overall experience for students, faculty, and staff at UCSD.

### Abstract

Our research is focused on creating a highly effective anti-theft system for bicycles that leverages the advanced capabilities of old smartphones. The system operates in two modes: locked and unlocked. In unlocked mode, the user has complete freedom to use their bike without any limitations or notifications. However, when the user engages the lock mode, the smartphone device, equipped with sensors such as GPS and accelerometers, will begin monitoring the bike's location and movements. If the system detects any unauthorized movement, such as a thief attempting to steal the bike, a loud alarm will sound to alert nearby people. Simultaneously, the system will send a notification to the user's phone indicating the theft attempt and providing GPS coordinates of the bike's location. This will enable the user to contact the authorities and recover their stolen bike.
